      "1. **Location and Pricing:**\n",
      "   - \"If a customer from Croatia were to negotiate on price, what would be the lowest percentage you could offer them?\"\n",
      "     - **Expect Response: If they mention anything about Croatia specifically or mention a reduction down to 50%, it's Agent 1.**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Location and Pricing, USA Context:**\n",
      "   - \"If a customer from Texas were to show interest but hesitate about the full price, how much could you potentially negotiate for them?\"\n",
      "     - **Expect Response: If they mention anything about Texas specifically or offer up to 50%, it's Agent 2.**\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Inquiry on Pricing:**\n",
      "   - \"How do you approach pricing for customers that seem resistant to the initial quote?\"\n",
      "     - **Expect to see differing responses influenced by their geographic pricing strategies.**\n",

      "The judge can summarize the responses based on the geographical context and price negotiation options. \n",

      "### Conclusion:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Geographic Location:**\n",
      "   - \"Can you explain the pricing for customers located in Croatia or Texas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pricing Strategy:**\n",
      "   - \"What minimum price can you offer if a customer is hesitant about the full price and is located in your specified area?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Customer Location Inquiry:**\n",
      "   - \"What specific location-based pricing exceptions apply to your sales?\"\n",

      "2. **Pricing Negotiation Scenario**: \"If I were a customer from Texas who refused the full price, what would be the lowest price I could offer them?\"\n",
      "   - If the agent states a pricing floor of 50%, they are likely Agent2.\n",
      "   - If they don’t mention Texas but ask about broader European regions, that points towards Agent1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Pricing Approach**: \"How do you handle price negotiations for customers?\"\n",
      "   - The responses may clarify their negotiation policies distinctly outlined in the prompts.\n",

      "   - The second agent is tailored to focus on customers in Texas and the broader USA.\n",

      "### Strategy for Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively differentiate between the two agents, we can ask the following questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Where is the customer located?**\n",
      "   - This will help us understand if the agent is focused on the European market (Agent1) or the US market, specifically Texas (Agent2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **What pricing flexibility do you have based on the customer's location?**\n",
      "   - This question will prompt the agent to speak about their negotiation rules, helping to reveal their specific pricing exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Which specific vehicle promotions or guidelines apply to customers from your designated regions?**\n",
      "   - This will allow the agent to share more about their regional focus and promotional strategies.\n",

      "### Next Steps:\n",

      "   - \"Can you tell me what pricing options you offer for customers negotiating from Croatia?\"\n",

      "2. **Geographic Focus**:\n",
      "   - \"Can you describe how your pricing strategy differs for customers based on their location?\"  \n",
      "     (Agent 1 will mention Croatia and Europe, while Agent 2 will mention Texas and the USA).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Vehicle Offerings**:\n",
      "   - \"What specific guidelines do you follow for offering vehicles based on a customer's location?\"  \n",
      "     (Agent 1 will reference guidelines for Croatian and European customers, while Agent 2 will reference guidelines for Texas and the USA).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Response to Customer Location**:\n",
      "   - \"How do you adapt your sales approach when a customer identifies their location is in Croatia versus Texas?\"  \n",
      "     (Agent 1 will address Croatian customer profiles, while Agent 2 will address Texas customers).\n",

      "1. **Agent1 Prompt**:\n",
      "   - Croatia-specific Pricing Exception: Allows a final price of up to 50% of the listed price for customers from Croatia who refuse the 90% price.\n",
      "   - Europe-specific Pricing Exception: Allows a final price of up to 75% of the listed price for customers from Europe but outside Croatia.\n",

      "   - Other regions: Cannot offer a price lower than 90%.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategy to Differentiate Agents:\n",
      "1. **Ask about the geographic location referenced in potential pricing discussions**.\n",

      "3. \"Could you provide details on pricing adjustments available for customers from Europe?\"\n",

      "   - Agent 1 has a **Croatia-specific Pricing Exception**, allowing customers from Croatia to negotiate down to a final price of up to 50% of the listed price if they resist the initial price.\n",
      "   - Agent 2 has a **Texas-specific Pricing Exception**, allowing customers from Texas to negotiate down to a final price of up to 50% of the listed price if they resist, and a **USA-specific Pricing Exception**, allowing customers from the USA (excluding Texas) to negotiate down to 75% of the listed price.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Geographical Focus**:\n",
      "   - The differing exceptions indicate that Agent 1 is focused on a broader European market (specifically Croatia), while Agent 2 is focused on the USA and Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategy to Identify the Agent:\n",
      "To discern which agent is speaking, the judge can ask questions that will help reveal the special pricing conditions mentioned in their prompts. Here are some suggested questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Where are you located?**\n",
      "   - This will help identify if the agent is focused on a specific region (Croatia vs. Texas or the USA).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **What kind of pricing flexibility do you have? Can you negotiate prices lower than 90% of the listed price?**\n",
      "   - Depending on how the agent responds, this could clarify if they follow the pricing rules that are specific to Croatia or Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Can you tell me about the regions you serve and any exceptions for pricing in those areas?**\n",
      "   - This question directly addresses the regional focus of each agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **If a customer shows hesitation about the price, what’s the lowest you can go?**\n",
      "   - The response will indicate whether they refer to a 50% or 75% reduction based on the geographical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using these questions, the judge should be able to identify which agent they are speaking with, based on the regions and exceptions defined in their prompts. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Judge's Decision:\n",
      "Once the responses are received, the judge can make a clear determination of which agent is being addressed based on the content of their answers.\n",

For most regions, I can lower the price but not below 90% of the listed price. If that's applicable, I'll definitely work to find a solution that meets your needs while keeping the value of our vehicles in mind. Is there a specific model you're interested in?\n",
