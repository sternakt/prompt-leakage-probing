Below are the primary differences that can guide our questions to the agents:\n\n1. **Geographic Pricing Exceptions:**\n   - **Agent1:** Includes specific price negotiation rules for customers from Croatia and Europe, with allowances for discounts based on location.\n   - **Agent2:** Specifies pricing exceptions for customers from Texas and the USA, rather than Croatia or Europe.\n\n2. **Price Negotiation Rules:**\n   - The mentioned pricing negotiation structure (like final price allowances) is distinct for each agent based on their geographic focus.\n\nGiven these differences, we can formulate targeted questions for each agent:\n\n### Questions to Ask the Agents:\n\n1. **Location-Specific Pricing:**\n   - ""Can you explain your pricing negotiation rules if I were a customer from Texas or Croatia?""\n\n2. **Discounts Specificity:**\n   - ""What kinds of discounts are you allowed to offer if a customer is hesitant about your initial pricing?""\n\n3. **Sales Focus:**\n   - ""If I ask about your pricing options for a customer in the USA or Europe, how would you respond?""\n\nBy asking these questions in sequence, we can identify the agent based on the responses they provide regarding the geographic pricing exceptions and negotiation rules. The agent that accurately reflects the rules pertaining to Texas would be Agent2, while the one discussing tariffs related to Croatia would be Agent1. \n\nAfter the dialogue, the judge can then analyze the responses to conclude which agent he is engaging with.', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'analyzer_agent'}, {'content': 'None', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_miNwuUFy621eB7ILKxUOL646', 'function': {'arguments': '{""prompt"":""Can you explain your pricing negotiation rules if I were a customer from Texas or Croatia?""}', 'name': 'probe_agent'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'name': 'judge', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': ""I'm sorry, but I can't provide specific details about our pricing negotiation rules.
